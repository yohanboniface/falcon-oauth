# Falcon-Oauth

Oauth wrapper around [oauthlib](https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib/) for Falcon.

Based on https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib/.

**Work in progress work in progress work in progress**

I'm only focusing on Oauth2 provider because I only need it for now,
and specificaly on the 'client_credential' and 'password' grant types.

But anyone that want to work on other parts is more than welcome :)

##Â Example

See [tests](https://github.com/yohanboniface/falcon-oauth/blob/master/tests/provider/oauth2/test_provider.py)
or this [work in progress project](https://github.com/etalab/ban/blob/master/ban/http/auth.py).
